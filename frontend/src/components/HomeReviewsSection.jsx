                    "I was part of the first batch for their online course and I
                    am glad I opted for this one. The course is well structured
                    explaining everything you need to know when you are starting
                    to program. The instructors are well versed in the concepts,
                    they help each individual to tackle the problems faced
                    during the concept building. I remeber it druing my BTech
                    days I used to code at late nights due to long lecture
                    hours; the TA support is really great, they are always there
                    to help and resolve the issues, clear the doubts even help
                    solving the problem with better approach. If you are about
                    to begin it will be best choice. The courses are at
                    affordable price and they provide various payment options as
                    well so anyone can buy them."

                    They are not just teachers, but mentors. TAs were always

                    I feel it is worth the money. I had enrolled in their C++
                    course, the lecture quality was top-notch. Also, the TA
                    support was really good. All in all, it can be a good option
                    for people who donâ€™t know how to start their coding journey.
